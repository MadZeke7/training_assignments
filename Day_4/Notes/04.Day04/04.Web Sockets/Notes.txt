Web Sockets
~~~~~~~~~~~
--> The data can be passed in both directions as “packets”, without breaking the connection and the need of additional HTTP-requests.

--> WebSocket is especially great for services that require continuous data exchange, e.g. online games, real-time trading systems and so on.

--> WebSockets is a next-generation bidirectional communication technology for web applications which operates over a single socket and is exposed via a JavaScript interface in HTML 5 compliant browsers.

--> Once you get a Web Socket connection with the web server, you can send data from browser to server by calling a send() method, and receive data from server to browser by an onmessage event handler.


Events:		open, close, message, error
Methods:  send(),  close()

Steps to implement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.   Check support of WebSocket		 
2.   Create WebSocket  object with Server Url		
3.    Send the message to server  in onopen event		   
4.    Get the message in onmessage event
5.    Close the socket connection  in onclose event 
	
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.   Check support of WebSocket
		 if ("WebSocket" in window)
		 
2.   Create WebSocket  object with Server Url
		  var wsObj = new WebSocket("wss://javascript.info/article/websocket/demo/hello");
		  
3.    Send the message to server  in onopen event:
			wsObj.onopen = function() {                  
                  // Web Socket is connected, send data using send()
                  wsObj.send("Message to send");
                  alert("Message is sent...");
               };
			   
4.    Get the message in onmessage event:

	 wsObj.onmessage = function (event) { 
                  var received_msg = event.data;
                  alert("Message is received..." + received_msg);
               };
			   
5.  Close the socket connection  in onclose event:  
			ws.onclose = function() {                   
                  // websocket is closed.
                  alert("Connection is closed..."); 
               };
