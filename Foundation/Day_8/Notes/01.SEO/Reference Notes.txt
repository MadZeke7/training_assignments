1.  Meta Tag
~~~~~~~~~~~~


The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. 
Metadata is data (information) about data.
<meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.
Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.


Sample Usae:
		<head>
					<meta  name="keywords"  content=".NET , JAVA, PHP, jQuery, Angular" />
				<meta  name="description"  content="This is the best Software development company in India." />
				<meta  name="viewport"  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /> 
		</head>

2. Microdata


Why do we need Microdata?
--> Essentially, microdata is one of the code languages designed to provide search-engine spider programs with information about website content. 
--> Usually, HTML tags tell the browser how to display the information included in the tag
--> However, the HTML tag doesn't give any information about what that text string means.
--> It this can make it more difficult for search engines to intelligently display relevant content to a user.


What is Microdata?
--> Microdata is a standardized way to provide additional semantics in your web pages.
--> Microdata lets you define your own customized elements and start embedding custom properties in your web pages. 
--> At a high level, microdata consists of a group of name-value pairs.
--> The groups are called items, and each name-value pair is a property. 
--> Items and properties are represented by regular elements.

Sample Usage:

	<div itemscope>					
				<p>My name is <span itemprop="name">Narasimha</span>
					I live in <span itemprop="city">Hyderabad</span>,
					<span itemprop="country">India</span></p>		
	</div>
