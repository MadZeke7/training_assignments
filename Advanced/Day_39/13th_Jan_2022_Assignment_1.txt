1. What is Unit Testing? Why do we do Unit Testing?
A)  Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually tested for proper operation. 
The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an important step in the development process, because if done correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later testing stages.
